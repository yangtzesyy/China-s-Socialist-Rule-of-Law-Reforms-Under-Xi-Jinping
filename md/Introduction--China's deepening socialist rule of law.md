## China's Socialist Rule of Law

rule of law should **be advanced under the CPC leadership**, **in line with socialism with Chinese characteristics**

Three broad organizing principles

* Ideological factors: rule of law? rule by law? a mixture?
  * "socialist rule of law" and associated constitutional implications
  * the boundaries around the power of the Party and the law
  * the proper relationship of the Party and state with regard to the judiciary and the administration of justice more generally. 
* Economic influences on reform implementation: political economy, legal and judicial practice and procedural fairness
* International influence (interaction)

Three theoretical assuptions

* There is no single ‘correct’ or ‘one best way’ legal model for the PRC.
* The PRC government is aware of many of the problems associated with promoting rule of law concepts and views rule of law development as a very high priority that will take a long time to achieve. At times, there will be more progress on some fronts than on others.
* It is difficult to achieve a completely impartial evaluation of different legal systems

## Forging a socialist rule of law with Chinese characteristics

Opinions about the fate of China’s legal system are as diverse as those about China’s economic future

* Chinese variant of democracy^[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341068118_JUDICIAL_REFORMS_IN_CHINA_THE_WAY_OF_STRENGTHENING_THE_JUDICIAL_INDEPENDENCE]
* remnant of Marxist-Leninist rule-by-law
* a hybrid form of non-democratic socialist rule of law^[*Law, Wealth and Power in China: Commercial Law Reforms in Context*]

Ideology is central to current debates over judicial reforms

* party leaders have expressed concern that legal institutions can be used to undermine the Party’s power
