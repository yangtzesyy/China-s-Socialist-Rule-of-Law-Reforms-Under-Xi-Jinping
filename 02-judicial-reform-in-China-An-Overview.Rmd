## Introduction

> It is perhaps impractical to expect that the current judicial reform, ambitious as it is, will make the Chinese judiciary truly independent by western standards. A party that is essentially above the law

> --Qianfan Zhang, 2003

**Judicial reform in the first decade** was rather **consistent in working toward a more professional and less politicized judiciary**, but **that direction was reversed in the third phase of judicial reform from 2008 to 2013**, when the new president of the SPC highlighted ‘the leadership of the party’ as one of the ‘Three Supremes’ (三个至上) to be followed by courts in adjudicating cases.

Now the curtain has been raised for the new phase of judicial reform, which signifies a return to the initial path of professionalization

## The judicial syndrome

Historical context

Four aspects to this syndrome

* low professional quality
* lack of institutional independence and heavy reliance on local party-governments
* lack of individual independence of judges within the courts
* rampant judicial corruption that adds constraints to the judicial reform

## The judicial reforms (1999-2013) and their assessments

Four types of problem

* local protectionism that seriously undermined the uniformity of law
* the overall low professional and moral quality of Chinese judges, which makes them prone to corruption and unfit for impartial administration of justice
* the bureaucratic management model that is at odds with judicial independence and efficiency
* the lack of material provisions necessary for effective court functioning, especially of basic-level courts

## Toward a more professional judiciary: the First and Second Outlines of judicial reform

The First Outline

* professionalize the heavily politicized courts法官选任

* improve the quality of judicial reasoning司法公开

* relatively little with respect to the institutional structure of the courts, local protectionism and judicial corruption

* its **achievements were limited**. It did change the outlook of the judiciary, but improvements to the quality of judicial opinions were far less than hoped

  * legal knowledge and techniques can easily be used to conceal corrupt practices rather than serve justice

    > A trained legal mind can easily manipulate judicial jargon to cover up traces of political or administrative interference

Compared to its predecessor, **the Second Outline** was more cautious in goal-setting, limiting itself to **technical improvements** such as the establishment of **a unified bar examination scheme and ‘case guidance system’**, **the prohibition of extortion for confession and extended detention** and the **recentralization of the power to review death-sentence judgments by the SPC**.

## The Third Outline: "judicial populism" or back to political control

This so-called line of ‘judicial reform’ only undermines judicial fairness and invites even more political interference in activities that properly belong to courts.

Nor can ad hoc popular intervention promise **any consistency of judgments in similar cases**

The retreat of the third ‘reform’ illustrates inherent limits that are, to an extent, common to all judicial reforms. Ambitious as it was, the first reform failed to change the power structure both within and outside the courts.

## The new reform (2014-present)

Three major aspects

* 保证依法独立公正行使审判权和检察权，改革司法管理体制，推进省以下地方法院和检察院人财物统一管理，探索建立与行政区域充分分离的司法管辖安排，建立国家法律的统一适用。
* 完善司法权力行使机制，......改革司法委员会，完善主审法官或合议庭审理案件的责任制，做到让审理者裁判，让裁判者负责
* 司法公开

## Conclusion

Two key areas of the Fourth Reform

1. a limited deregulation of the courtroom
2. centralization of judicial administration to reduce local protectionism
